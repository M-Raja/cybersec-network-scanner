2. **Scan Type** - Choose from:
   - Quick scan (common ports)
   - Range scan (custom ports)
   - Full scan (1-1000)

### Command Line Options
```bash
# Scan specific IP
python3 simple_scanner.py --target 127.0.0.1

# Quick scan only
python3 simple_scanner.py --quick

# Verbose output
python3 simple_scanner.py --verbose
```

---

## Testing & Practice

### Safe Testing Targets (In Order of Safety)

#### 1. Localhost (Always Safe)
```bash
# Target: 127.0.0.1
# Expected: Local services, development servers
python3 simple_scanner.py
# Enter: 127.0.0.1
```

#### 2. Your Own VM
```bash
# Find your VM's IP
ip addr show

# Look for: 192.168.x.x or 10.0.x.x
# Example: 10.0.2.15 (NAT network)
```

#### 3. Your Windows Host
```bash
# On Windows CMD:
ipconfig
# Note the IPv4 Address

# From Kali, scan that IP
```

#### 4. Your Router (Be Careful!)
```bash
# Usually: 192.168.1.1 or 10.0.0.1
# Only scan your own router!
```

### Finding IP Addresses

#### In Kali Linux:
```bash
# Show all network interfaces
ip addr show

# Show routing table
ip route show

# Quick IP check
hostname -I
```

#### In Windows:
```bash
# Open CMD and type:
ipconfig

# Look for "IPv4 Address" under your active adapter
```

## What to Look For

### Common Open Ports & Services

| Port | Service | Description | Security Risk | Status |
|------|---------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| 21 | FTP | File Transfer Protocol | **High** (unencrypted) | ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| 22 | SSH | Secure Shell | **Low** (if configured properly) | ‚úÖ |
| 23 | Telnet | Remote Login | **High** (unencrypted) | ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| 25 | SMTP | Email Server | **Medium** | ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| 53 | DNS | Domain Name System | **Low** | ‚úÖ |
| 80 | HTTP | Web Server | **Medium** | ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| 135 | RPC | Remote Procedure Call | **High** | ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| 139 | NetBIOS | Windows Networking | **High** | ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| 443 | HTTPS | Secure Web Server | **Low** | ‚úÖ |
| 445 | SMB | Windows File Sharing | **High** | ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| 993 | IMAPS | Secure Email | **Low** | ‚úÖ |
| 995 | POP3S | Secure Email | **Low** | ‚úÖ |
| 3389 | RDP | Remote Desktop | **Medium** | ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| 5900 | VNC | Remote Desktop | **High** | ‚ö†Ô∏è |

### Expected Results by Target

#### Localhost (127.0.0.1)
- **Common**: 22 (SSH), 53 (DNS), 631 (printing)
- **Development**: 3000, 5000, 8000 (web servers)
- **Database**: 3306 (MySQL), 5432 (PostgreSQL)

#### Windows Host
- **System**: 135 (RPC), 139 (NetBIOS), 445 (SMB)
- **Remote**: 3389 (RDP) if enabled
- **Web**: 80, 443 if IIS is running

#### Router
- **Management**: 80 (web interface), 22 (SSH)
- **Services**: 53 (DNS), 67 (DHCP)

## Safety Features

### Built-in Protections
1. **Private Network Detection** - Warns when scanning public IPs
2. **Rate Limiting** - Prevents overwhelming targets
3. **Input Validation** - Validates all user inputs
4. **Error Handling** - Graceful handling of network errors
5. **Confirmation Prompts** - Asks before scanning public networks

### Best Practices
- ‚úÖ Always test on your own systems first
- ‚úÖ Use virtual machines for practice
- ‚úÖ Get written permission before scanning
- ‚úÖ Document your testing procedures
- ‚úÖ Respect rate limits and timeouts
- ‚ùå Never scan without authorization
- ‚ùå Don't scan production systems
- ‚ùå Avoid scanning during business hours

## Understanding Results

### Port States
- **OPEN** - Service is running and accepting connections
- **CLOSED** - Port is reachable but no service listening
- **FILTERED** - Firewall blocking the port
- **UNREACHABLE** - Host is down or network issue

### Service Information
- **Banner Grabbing** - Attempts to identify service versions
- **Protocol Detection** - Identifies the protocol in use
- **Service Mapping** - Maps ports to common services

### Risk Assessment
- **High Risk** - Unencrypted services, default credentials
- **Medium Risk** - Services with known vulnerabilities
- **Low Risk** - Properly configured secure services

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Connection Refused"
- Target is not running the service
- Firewall is blocking connections
- Wrong IP address

#### "Timeout"
- Network is slow
- Target is filtering connections
- Service is not responding

#### "Permission Denied"
- Need administrative privileges
- Firewall blocking outbound connections
- Network restrictions

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable verbose output
python3 simple_scanner.py --verbose --debug

# Check network connectivity
ping -c 4 [target_ip]

# Test specific port manually
telnet [target_ip] [port]
```
